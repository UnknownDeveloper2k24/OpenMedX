### API Configuration

**Hugging Face API Key:** ✅ Configured
**Models Used:**
- `microsoft/BioGPT-Large` (AI Health Coaches)
- `google/medgemma-4b-it` (Advanced features - with fallback)

**API Parameters:**
- Temperature: 0.7 (balanced creativity/accuracy)
- Max tokens: 400-700 (depending on feature)
- Top-p: 0.9 (nucleus sampling)

### Fallback Mechanism
All features include intelligent fallback:
- If AI API unavailable → Knowledge-based responses
- If model loading → Graceful degradation
- If rate limited → Cached medical knowledge
- Always functional, never breaks

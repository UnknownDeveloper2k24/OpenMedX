console.log(data.analysis.findings);
console.log(data.analysis.severity);
```

### Example 3: Generate Patient Report
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/report-generator', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    patientInfo: { age: 35, gender: "Male", bmi: 24.5 },
    vitalSigns: {
      bloodPressure: "120/80",
      heartRate: "72",
      temperature: "98.6",
      respiratoryRate: "16",
      oxygenSaturation: "98"
    },
    chiefComplaint: "Persistent headache",
    symptoms: ["Headache", "Fatigue", "Dizziness"]
  })
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.report.diagnosis);
console.log(data.reportId);
```

## Monitoring & Logging

All MedGemma API calls are logged for:
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking

```

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Configured:**
   - Ensure `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
   - Verify API key is valid and active

2. **Model Loading Time:**
   - First request may take 10-20 seconds (model loading)
   - Subsequent requests are faster (2-5 seconds)

3. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Hugging Face free tier has rate limits
   - Consider upgrading for production use

4. **Fallback Responses:**
   - If you see "Fallback" in model field, API is unavailable
   - Check API key and network connectivity

## Conclusion

The integration of MedGemma represents a significant upgrade to OpenMedX's AI capabilities.
